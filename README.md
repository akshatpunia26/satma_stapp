# indian geospatial analysis

A streamlit app for geospatial applications focusing on the Indian Subcontinent based on [streamlit-option-menu](https://github.com/victoryhb/streamlit-option-menu).

The code has also been forked from two repositories by https://github.com/giswqs. It has then been modified according to the desired application and brought under a single interface.
